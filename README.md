Comment: I spent two and half days on this projects from scratch (I do not have experience in building SPA with Vue (I have SPA experience with Angular), and most of features were done. I did not do the pagination / load more because the given API will only return 21 results at most, no matter you pass 'page' param with api or not, it will only return 21 results. Antoher issue I think is Github api server's CROS issue, I spent a lot of time on it.
